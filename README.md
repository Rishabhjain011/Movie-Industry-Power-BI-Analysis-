# Movie-Industry-Power-BI-Analysis
# Overview
Welcome to the Movie Industry Data Analysis Case Study! In this project, we have utilized Power BI to analyze two comprehensive datasets: Movie Revenue and Ratings and Movie Production Details. The goal is to uncover valuable insights into the dynamics of the movie industry, focusing on financial success, audience reception, and production factors such as budgets, genres, and directors.

This report and the accompanying interactive dashboard provide a detailed analysis of the movie industry’s performance, revealing key trends, correlations, and patterns that could shape strategic decisions for movie production, marketing, and investment.
